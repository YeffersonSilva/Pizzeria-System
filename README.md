## üõ† Technologies Used

This project makes use of several key technologies for backend development, database management, coding efficiency, and deployment. Here's a brief overview of each:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js facilitates building scalable network applications. It's known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications across distributed devices.

  ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)

- **TypeScript**: An open-source language that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions. TypeScript aims to make the code more understandable and less prone to runtime errors by providing types and interfaces.

  ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications.

- **Docker**: A set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
